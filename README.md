## Project Introduction
Need: National Geographic Society wants use a time series of satellite imagery to better characterize vulnerable habitat, in order to improve risk assessment, investment planning, and program impact assessments. 

Challenge: What is the average NDVI curve for areas of the Zambezi strip in Southern Africa?

Goal: The project seeks to establish baseline land cover dynamics of selected high-value habitats that may serve as a foundation for subsequent wilderness monitoring efforts that leverage machine learning and anomaly detection algorithms.
